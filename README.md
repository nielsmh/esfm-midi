This is a DOS program, compiled with Open Watcom 1.9.

It plays sound via the ESFM synthesizer chipset, found on ESS AudioDrive
sound cards from the mid to late 1990's.

Currently this provides support for playing via the computer keyboard,
and will later be extended to be playable via MIDI In on MPU-401.
